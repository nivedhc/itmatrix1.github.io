                             who is blessed with a melodious voice was once again called up for another beautiful song.
                              It was definitely a pleasant gift to our cars. Moving on with the programs of the day, the
                               felicitation for toppers. The certificates were presented to the toppers, placement holders
                                and last not the least to all the final year students who passed out with flying colours
                                 by our chairman, Muneer Sir. A special greetings to Nived Mc for his outstanding
                                  achievement in the second year university exam, was also made. That was a wrap to the
                                   formal event and thus we ended it with a video constituting the entire college life
                                    of our seniors. Indeed, a beautiful rewind to the best days of their life.
                                     Our seniors then came forward one by one to share some beautiful memories they
                                      experienced in their college life.</p>

                            We then decided to take a very short break before continuing with our cultural programs for 
                            the day. Shortly after, we resumed the event with some fun games like song master and
                             tricky twisters. All students from all the three years actively participated in the games
                              and had lots of fun. A fun session with lots of fun and laughter. Now, to mark a beautiful 
                              end to a beautiful day, the students of the second and third year BCA came up with
                              a beautiful Onam video that consisted of all the beautiful elements of Onam.
                              It definitely was an incredible end to an even incredible day.
                             With that being said we came to the end of the event. Final adieu, 
                             until we meet again.
