              <b><i>"IGEN-21"</i></b>a virtual farewell party for the final year
              studentsof the BCA department hosted by the junior year students and
               teachers. To bring out the real fun of an event, some cultural 
               programs were incorporated as well to make itafarewell-cum-cultural
                fest. The event startedat9:45 am sharp on the 17th of august. 
                We began with a welcome speech by our host of the day, Malavika,
                 final year BCA student. As the saying goes, when a day starts and 
                 ends with a prayer, everything in between goes well , we started out
                  with a prayer song by our second year student Keerthana. A short 
                  video with the overview of our entire department along with all our
                   achievements were presented shortly after. Our HOD, Miss Reshma,
                    then addressed the gathering. She then called upon, Muneer sir,
                     our chairman to inaugurate the ceremony along with a fewwords.

                     some words of encouragement and wisdom by our teachers
                      Miss Bindhu, Miss Preethi, Miss Shyamily and Jithesh Sir. 
                      To wind up the formal session, Muhas, also a final year student,
                       was called up to deliver the vote of speech.The event IGEN-21,

                                student, was called up to deliver the vote of speech.</p>
         <p>For a bit of an entertainment before continuing with the ceremony, Keerthana
          who is blessed with a melodious voice was once again called up for another beautiful song.
           It was definitely a pleasant gift to our cars. Moving on with the programs of the day, the
            felicitation for toppers. The certificates were presented to the toppers, placement holders
             and last not the least to all the final year students who passed out with flying colours
              by our chairman, Muneer Sir. A special greetings to Nived Mc for his outstanding
               achievement in the second year university exam, was also made. That was a wrap to the
                formal event and thus we ended it with a video constituting the entire college life
                 of our seniors. Indeed, a beautiful rewind to the best days of their life.
                  Our seniors then came forward one by one to share some beautiful memories they
                   experienced in their college life.</p>
      
     <p>  We then decided to take a very short break before continuing with our cultural programs for 
      the day. Shortly after, we resumed the event with some fun games like song master and
       tricky twisters. All students from all the three years actively participated in the games
        and had lots of fun. A fun session with lots of fun and laughter. Now, to mark a beautiful 
        end to a beautiful day, the students of the second and third year BCA came up with
        a beautiful Onam video that consisted of all the beautiful elements of Onam.
        It definitely was an incredible end to an even incredible day.
       With that being said we came to the end of the event. Final adieu, 
       until we meet again.
